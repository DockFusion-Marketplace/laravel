# Laravel in Docker
This is a pre-configured Laravel environment designed to run seamlessly with DockFusion - your Docker app manager. This template provides an out-of-the-box Laravel development setup with Docker, including PHP, and Apache, so you can focus on building your app, not on configuring your stack.

## ðŸš€ What's Included
The quickest way to get started with the Deck Laravel Development Container is using docker-compose.

- Laravel (9+) â€” PHP web framework
- PHP (8.0+) â€” Handles PHP processing
- NVM (0.40.2) â€” Manages multiple Node.js versions with ease
- NODE (20+) â€” JavaScript runtime for backend tools, asset building, and full-stack functionality
- npm/yarn â€” Package managers for installing Node-based tooling like Vite and Laravel Mix
- Apache â€” Serves your Laravel app
- Composer â€” Dependency management
- Docker Compose â€” Multi-container orchestration
